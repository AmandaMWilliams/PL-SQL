<h4> What is %Type?</h4>
%Type gets the datatype of the referenced column or value and assigns 
this datatype to the declared variable.

<h4> Uses</h4>
If we are working in a DB and the SALARY column precision is set to 6, 
but now someone is making more than 6 figures, there will be errors.  
To resolve the errors, we will need to find every place where the 
precision is 6 and change it to accommodate. This may be difficult or 
tedious. But if we use %Type when we are creating our code, it will 
automatically update in those places when the root variable precision 
is updated. <br>
